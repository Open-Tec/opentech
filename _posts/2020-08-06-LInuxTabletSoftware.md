This is a growing list of software that I have found that works best on tablet devices that can run Linux

### Touch Friendly Software

Mostly optimized intentially or unintentially for touch.

- Gnome Notes
- Geary
- Gnome Calenar (still hate it)
- Gnome Contact
- Gnome Feeds
- Gnome To Do
- Gnome Settings
- Password Safe
- Fractal
- Gnome Clock
- Basically most Gnome software projects

### Mostly Touch Friendly Software

The interface is partially friendly for touch but part of the interface is not optimized for touch

- Evolution

### Stylus Friendly Software

This software may not be "touch friendly" but works great with a Stylus.  Most Windows Tablets are just Wacom Tablets like the Thinkpad 10 or the Thinkpad Helix 2.

- Xournal++
- OpenBoard
- Drawpile
