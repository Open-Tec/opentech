I has been 1 year since IBM completed the acquisition of Red Hat.  Last year after the acquisition I honestly didn't know what to expect.  I was excited and a little scared because I wasn't sure what the future would hold given IBM's reputation.  A year in Red Hat is still Red Hat.  

I have now worked for Red Hat going on 8 years and there has been a lot of change in those 8 years as you would expect from a rapidly growing company and the year in nothing has changed that wouldn't have changed anyway.  I've had great interactions with my counterparts at IBM and we are working very well togethersud.  It has been more productive than I ever would have imaged.  There is mutal respect between the different organizations and I couldn't be happier with the results so far.

When I was developing my interest in computers in the mid to late 90s, I had a goal to work for IBM because of their envolvement and investment in the open source movement.  IBM's commitment to Open Soruce is obvious making the largest software acquisition in history!  Red Hat has a very bright future and I'm excited that I'm still a Red Hatter and to some degree a year in as an IBMer!
